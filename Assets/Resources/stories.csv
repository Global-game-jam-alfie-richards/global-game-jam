Just so i know what it is,,,Where the event canvas will be,Overall Positivity. If sad positive is more likely. True or false,True or false. Insane events will only have a chance of happening when the insanity stat is high enough,Higher or lower chance of events happening. 1 is high 0.1 is low,Negative is negative effect to happiness. Positive is positive effect,These will add and subtract directly from the happiness. 1 is like ecstatic 0 is suicidal,Event timeframe. This is the minimum day it can happen,,A month in this game is 30 days. There will be 3 months of gameplay. The player plays every 3 days of this guys life. Meaning there will be 30 days of their playtime. 3-5 events will happen per day,,ALFIE YOU REMOVED ALL THE 3RD CHOICE COLUMNS REMEMBER
